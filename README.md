# A* PathfindingGraph in C++

This is a simple implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm using C++.  
It’s also the **very first project** I’ve uploaded to GitHub.

Although the day I become a real game developer still feels far away,  
tonight marks the beginning of that journey.

I’m just a lazy, clumsy man who feels like he has already lost his youth，but this is a step forward, and that matters.

I hope this pathfinding code not only helps me find paths in code,  
but also becomes a small part of my own life’s path  
**toward the dream I’ve always wanted to reach: to make a game with my own hands.**

Thank you for visiting this project. 🌱  
Feel free to explore, use, and improve it.
